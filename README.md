## Git vs. GitHub
Git is a type of coding that allows you have access to all previous versions of your project. While Github is a place where you upload all those projects.


---
## Initial Setup
You make an account by entering an email, password and username to create a github account. You can now use this account to log into GitHub and CS50 which is your provate IDE. [a link to do that](github.com/hstatsep/ide50)

## Repository Setup
If you plan on uploading your repository to github then make a repository in guthub by clicking the plus in the top right corner of your tab and click "new repository" then name the new repository whatever you want the name of the directory in CS50 to be as well. Refer to the Workflow and commands section to see how to push changes to a new repository.

## Workflow & Commands
A workflow is the proccess of making changes to something then psuhing it to github in order for other people to see those changes.
After you have made the changes you want use Git add to tell git you are ready so commit the changes you made
Then git commit to save the changes you made and git init to initialize your new github repository that you just made.
Lastly you git push in order to push your new version to github.
